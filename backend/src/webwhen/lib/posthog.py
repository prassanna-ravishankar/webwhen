"""
PostHog analytics client for backend.

Thread-safe singleton with double-checked locking.
This pattern is safe in Python due to GIL guaranteeing atomic reference
assignment. The outer check avoids lock contention after initialization.

All functions gracefully handle errors - analytics failures never break core functionality.
